# Fuel-Log-NCC
## Logging and report generating for golf course fuel usage

This project aims to fix an outdated problem for golf courses who need to report their fuel usage and expenses per month. These solutions, in the past, have relied heavily on convoluted Excel spreadsheets, photocopies (of photocopies) of conversion tables, and/or tedious math work. The goal was to create a user-friendly input system that took care of all of the organizing and math behind the hood while leaving a clear paper trail for users to refer back to.
